# Electron ArtGEN

This app is intended as an exploration into the features of Electron, since I have never used this framework before.

My goal is to make an application that can generate pseudo-random artpieces. In doing so, I will be able to learn a number things about creating apps in Electron:
- how to build & deploy on multiple platforms
- how to move between different application screens
- how to save data from the app to local storage
- and more!
